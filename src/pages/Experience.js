  "I worked on the IBM TM1 server team as a backend developer, mainly working on optimizing their testing processes by modernizing their toolkit through building out new tools. While at IBM I created a concurrent testing tool with a wide variety of features such as: native support for JavaScript-based tests, Postman collection translation and execution, testing groups for test modularization, and instant feedback and execution halting for tests that return errors during concurrent execution",
  "At OpenText I worked as a frontend developer. Over the course of the term I worked on their in-house SCSS library to expanded it out significantly and I made recordings for future users, explaining how to use the library. I also worked on the Service level agreements team (SLA) to build out missing features, such as scheduled user notifications.",
  "Bitback is a startup focused on providing consumers with cashback rewards at their favourite stores by using their app. The development team consisted of only 2 people, including myself, and I worked on building out a lot of the backend, as well as optimizing their existing database through rigorous analysis of execution plans and queries.",
  "At IBM I worked on the Skills Network team as a backend developer. My responsibilities here consisted of choosing to work on any one of the numerous projects this team handles and then build out requested features with a lot of freedom for implementation choices. I worked largely in Go and used knowledge of Docker, Kubernetes, and Ansible to accomplish a lot of tasks.",
  "Tugolo is a travel startup akin to airbnb where vendors can offer experiences, like a tour guide, rather than living accomodations. I worked on a small team of 3 developers to build the platform from scratch and I worked on creating a lot of user account recovery options, as well as building the website."
